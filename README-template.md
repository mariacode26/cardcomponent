## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I trained my skills with css flexbox and responsiveness


```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 820px) {
    .container{
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
    }
    .item1 {
        width: 80%;
        margin-bottom: 40px;
        height: 100%;
        border-radius:  0 0 8px 8px;
        
    }
```




### Continued development

next step will be to learn css grid
